*Multimodal dermatology research toolkit for pairing dermoscopy imagery with contextual patient data.*

## Research Abstract
BioSignal-X advances biomedical AI by fusing dermoscopic imagery with patient metadata to train multimodal classifiers capable of nuanced lesion assessment. The platform integrates Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability, Streamlit for interactive analysis, and Hugging Face Spaces for accessible deployment—supporting rapid experimentation and transparent clinical research workflows.

## Key Features
- Multimodal learning pipeline combining image embeddings with tabular biosignal metadata
- Explainability via Grad-CAM overlays and PDF report generation
- Real-time inference delivered through a Streamlit user interface
- Seamless deployment to Hugging Face Spaces with automated CI triggers
- Biomedical research alignment with reproducible preprocessing and training utilities

## Model Card
**Architecture:** BioSignal-X integrates an EfficientNet-B0 visual backbone with a metadata fusion layer, enabling joint processing of dermoscopic images and demographic or clinical features.  
**Input Format:** RGB lesion images (224×224) with associated metadata tensors.  
**Output:** Binary or multiclass prediction logits and Grad-CAM heatmaps visualizing model focus regions.  
**Training Data:** Synthetic data generated for development; future versions target open biomedical datasets such as ISIC 2019 (skin lesions) and PhysioNet signals.  
**Intended Use:** Biomedical education, interpretability research, and AI-driven visualization — *not for diagnostic use.*

## Dataset
Current version uses synthetic datasets to simulate real-world variability.  
Future integration planned with:
- [ISIC 2019 Challenge Dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/)
- [PhysioNet Biomedical Signals](https://physionet.org/)  
Users may fine-tune or replace datasets through configurable `data_loader.py`.

## Ethical Considerations
BioSignal-X is a research and educational framework. Predictions are not validated for clinical application.  
The project encourages responsible use of medical AI, transparency in model interpretability, and fairness across demographic groups.  
Any deployment in healthcare contexts must follow institutional review and regulatory standards.

## Clinical Validation
- External cohort evaluation via `clinical_validation/validate_clinical.py` with MC Dropout uncertainty and per-case JSON outputs.
- Group-level summaries by site and demographics (sex, age bins, skin type where available).
- Inter-site variance analysis in `benchmarks/compare_baselines.ipynb` produces CSV and boxplot artifacts.

## MLflow Experiment Tracking
Optional MLflow integration logs hyperparameters, per-epoch metrics (loss, accuracy, AUC, ECE, Brier, MC Dropout entropy), and artifacts (checkpoints, calibration CSVs, clinical validation outputs). Enable with `--mlflow` flag after setting `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` and optional `MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT` environment variables.

Example (PowerShell):
```
$env:MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="http://localhost:5000"; $env:MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT="BioSignalX"; python train.py --epochs 5 --mlflow
```

## Drift Detection
Automated cohort shift monitoring via `monitoring/drift_detector.py` computes Jensen–Shannon divergence across numeric (e.g., age) and categorical (e.g., lesion_site, gender) features.

Run a drift check comparing a historical reference vs current intake:
```
python -m monitoring.drift_detector --ref data/reference/metadata.csv --cur data/current/metadata.csv --out logs/drift_report.json
```
Outputs a JSON report with per-feature scores and an overall drift rate suitable for scheduled jobs (e.g., weekly CI).

## Evaluation Report Notebook
Notebook `notebooks/generate_eval_report.ipynb` (planned) will aggregate calibration (`results/calibration_report.csv`), fairness, inter-site variability, and clinical validation summaries into a consolidated PDF/table bundle for publication or internal review.

## Regulatory Alignment
- See `docs/compliance_guidelines.md` for SaMD, EU MDR, and ISO references with capability mapping.
- Calibration reporting (ECE, Brier), traceability logs, and versioned artifacts support reproducibility.

## Governance & Traceability
- Training logs: `results/calibration_report.csv`, `checkpoints/metrics.csv`.
- Traceability: `logs/traceability.json` records model hash, config, dataset, and timestamps.
- Literature and experimental roadmap guide bias audits and reader study planning.

### Reflex Integrity Sentinel Scoring
Integrity = 100 − (Σ violations × 15 + Σ warnings × 2.5)

Notes:
• Violations represent critical rule breaches (e.g., missing required artifacts, non-monotonic timestamps, data integrity failures, parameter incoherence). Each violation deducts 15 points.
• Warnings represent tolerable inconsistencies (e.g., minor cross-validation mismatches, insufficient history, missing optional fields). Each warning deducts 2.5 points.
• Score is clamped to [0, 100].

Adaptive-learning gates below 70 are skipped for safety.

## Post-Market Surveillance (Planned)
Upcoming modules will extend drift detection, adverse event logging, and periodic performance re-evaluation aligned with ISO 14971 risk controls and IEC 62304 maintenance procedures.

## 🔐 Trust & Compliance Federation

The Reflex Governance Framework now maintains a live, verifiable trust and compliance layer.  
All operations are validated nightly and weekly across distributed nodes.

**Automated Components**

- **Trust-Mode Validation** (`trust_validation.yml`)  
  Runs every Sunday 07:30 UTC.  
  Generates `logs/trust_validation_report.json` showing archive, ledger, and anchor hashes.

- **Federated Trust Exchange** (`trust_federation.yml`)  
  Cross-validates `governance_ledger_hash.json` and `integrity_anchor.json` among peers.  
  Report: `trust_federation_report.json` → status `verified` when all peers align.

- **Autonomous DOI Steward** (`autonomous_doi_steward.yml`)  
  Keeps Zenodo metadata synchronized with the latest certified release.  
  Logs to `results/doi_steward_log.jsonl`.

- **Public Compliance Validator** (`public_compliance_validator.yml`)  
  Nightly run ensures every ledger entry is timestamped, hashed, and certified.  
  Outputs `portal/public_compliance_status.json` → displayed on the portal home as  
  **“Compliance Status: Verified ✅”**

**Portal Access**

- [Governance Portal](./portal/index.html) – live compliance banner  
- [Trust Federation Report](./results/trust_federation_report.json) – latest cross-ledger check  
- [Public Compliance Status](./portal/public_compliance_status.json) – validator output  
- [Provenance Ledger](./portal/ledger.html) – full timeline and hash history

All workflows are dry-run-safe: if Zenodo tokens are absent, they still produce complete reports locally.

### Forecast Risk Scoring
Predictive governance intelligence with automated risk evaluation:
- **Forecast Deviation Index (FDI)**: Measures prediction accuracy as `|predicted - actual| / predicted × 100`
  - Excellent: FDI < 5% (strong model performance)
  - Good: FDI < 10% (acceptable accuracy)
  - Drifting: FDI ≥ 10% (requires recalibration)
- **Confidence Stability (CS)**: Tracks forecast confidence variance (rolling std, window=10)
  - Stable: CS < 3.0 (low variance)
  - Unstable: CS ≥ 5.0 (high variance, review model inputs)
- **Current Status**: FDI = 0.0% (Excellent), CS = 2.1 (Stable)
- **Updates**: Twice weekly (Tuesday/Friday 00:30 UTC) via Meta-Forecast 2.0 engine

See [`reports/forecast_risk_assessment.json`](reports/forecast_risk_assessment.json) for full risk assessment details.

### Next Release Roadmap
Development planning for upcoming enhancements:
- **[v1.1 Release Planning](planning/RELEASE_PLANNING_v1.1.md)** — Meta-Forecast 2.0, adaptive feedback refinement, performance optimization (Target: Q1 2026)
