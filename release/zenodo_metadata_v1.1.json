  "notes": "Release v1.1.0 (March 2026) builds on v1.0.0-Whitepaper (November 2025) by adding predictive governance capabilities. This version includes 30+ historical data points (vs. 7 in v1.0), calibrated FDI/CS metrics (vs. baseline placeholders), and production-ready adaptive controller with alert integration. Reproducibility capsule contains: (1) predictive_engine/ config and workflows, (2) controllers/adaptive_v2/ risk-aware controller, (3) reports/ forecast risk assessments and adaptive outputs, (4) portal/ enhanced dashboard with forecast visualization, (5) forecast/ Q1 2026 predictions, (6) exports/ integrity metrics registry (30+ entries), (7) GOVERNANCE_TRANSPARENCY.md with API documentation. All timestamps ISO 8601 UTC. SHA-256 checksums included for artifact integrity verification.",
  "method": "Automated governance monitoring via GitHub Actions workflows. Predictive engine runs twice weekly (Tuesday/Friday 00:30 UTC) using 90-day rolling window to forecast 30-day ahead integrity and reproducibility. Adaptive controller executes after predictions and before nightly validation (02:00 UTC), adjusting learning rate factors based on FDI < 5% (excellent), FDI < 10% (good), FDI ≥ 10% (drifting), CS < 3.0 (stable), CS ≥ 5.0 (unstable). Risk assessment reports generated with each prediction cycle. Portal metrics API (portal/metrics.json) updated in real-time with FDI, CS, predicted integrity, and learning rate factors. All workflows idempotent and deterministic (fixed random seeds, versioned dependencies).",
